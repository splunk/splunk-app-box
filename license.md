YOU AGREE THAT, AS BETWEEN YOU AND SPLUNK, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACCURACY AND QUALITY OF YOUR DATA INPUT INTO ANY SPLUNK MATERIALS. BECAUSE THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY MAY NOT BE VALID IN SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS, THE ABOVE DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

**12.**     **LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. ** TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, SPLUNK'S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO YOU, FROM ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND ALL THEORIES OF LIABILITY, WILL BE LIMITED TO AND WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO SPLUNK UNDER THE APPLICABLE ORDER DOCUMENT GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY.

THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED THAT THESE LIMITATIONS WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY EVEN IF ANY REMEDY IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, SPLUNK WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF DATA ARISING FROM THE AUTOMATIC TERMINATION OF THE LICENSE RIGHTS GRANTED HEREIN AND ANY ASSOCIATED CESSATION OF THE FUNCTIONS OF THE SPLUNK MATERIALS. BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

**13.**     **PURCHASED SOFTWARE INDEMNITY. ** Provided your use of the Purchased Software was in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Splunk will defend, indemnify and hold you harmless from and against any loss, damage, liability or cost (including reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from any third party claim that the Purchased Software infringes or violates any third party's copyright or trademark rights; provided that you promptly notify Splunk in writing of any and all such claims. In the event of any loss, damage, liability or cost for which Splunk is obligated to indemnify you hereunder, Splunk shall have sole control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations, and you shall reasonably cooperate with Splunk in the defense and/or settlement thereof at Splunk's expense; provided that you may participate in such defense using your own counsel, at your own expense. The indemnification obligations set forth in this Section constitute your sole remedy, and Splunk's sole liability, with respect to any claims that the Purchased Software infringes any third party's intellectual property rights.

**14.**      **CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.**

**14.1**     **Confidential Information**. "**_Confidential Information_**" means any technical or business information, ideas, materials, know-how or other subject matter that is disclosed by one party to the other party that: (A) if disclosed in writing, is marked "confidential" or "proprietary" at the time of such disclosure; (B) if disclosed orally, is identified as "confidential" or "proprietary" at the time of such disclosure, and is summarized in a writing sent by the disclosing party to the receiving party within thirty (30) days after any such disclosure; or (C) under the circumstances, a person exercising reasonable business judgment would understand to be confidential or proprietary. "Confidential Information" of Splunk shall include the Splunk Materials, source code and the license keys to download the Software.

**14.2**     **Use and Disclosure Restrictions**. The party receiving Confidential Information ("**_Recipient_**") agrees: (i) to maintain the Confidential Information of the party disclosing such information (the "**_Discloser_**") in the strictest of confidence; (ii) not to disclose such Confidential Information to any third parties; and (iii) not to use any such Confidential Information for any purpose other than in furtherance of this Agreement and the activities described herein. Recipient will treat Confidential Information of the Discloser with the same degree of care as it accords to its own Confidential Information, but in no event with less than reasonable care. Recipient may disclose the Confidential Information of Discloser to its directors, officers, employees and consultants (collectively, "**_Representatives_**") who have a bona fide need to know such Confidential Information, but solely to the extent necessary to pursue the activities described herein and for no other purpose; <u>provided</u> that each such Representative first executes a written agreement (or is otherwise already bound by a written agreement) that contains use and nondisclosure restrictions at least as protective of the other party's Confidential Information as those set forth herein.

**14.3**     **Exclusions**. The obligations of Recipient under Section 14.2 shall not apply to any Confidential Information which: (a) is now or thereafter becomes generally known or available to the public, through no act or omission on the part of Recipient (or any of its Representatives, affiliates, or agents) or any third party subject to any use or disclosure restrictions with respect to such Confidential Information; (b) was known by or lawfully in the possession of Recipient, prior to receiving such information from Discloser, without restriction as to use or disclosure; (c) is rightfully acquired by Recipient from a third party who has the right to disclose it and who provides it without restriction as to use or disclosure; or (d) is independently developed by Recipient without access to any Confidential Information of Discloser.

**14.5**     **Independent Development**. Recipient reserves the right to develop and market any technology, products or services or pursue business opportunities that compete with or are similar to those disclosed by Discloser under this Agreement without the use of the Discloser's Confidential Information. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict Recipient from employing general ideas, concepts or techniques which may be retained in the unaided human memory by Recipient personnel in the course of their review of the Confidential Information (but without any attempt to memorize such information). The foregoing sentence shall not, however, grant Recipient any rights under any patents or copyrights.

**14.6**     **Return or Destruction of Confidential Information**. Upon termination of the Agreement or support and maintenance, Recipient will promptly return to Discloser, or at Discloser's option, destroy, all tangible items and embodiments containing or consisting of Discloser's Confidential Information and all copies thereof and provide written certification of such destruction or return by an authorized person.

**15.**     **TERMINATION. ** You may terminate this Agreement at any time by providing to Splunk a written statement signed by your authorized representative notifying Splunk that you are terminating the Agreement. If you are not a U.S. Government agency, department, or instrumentality, upon thirty (30) days notice, Splunk may terminate this Agreement (and your license rights) upon notice in the event that you breach any provision of this Agreement and have not cured the breach during such notice period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a material breach of any license granted to you shall be grounds for immediate termination. If You are a U.S. Government agency, department, or instrumentality, termination terms and conditions shall be governed by 48 C.F.R. § 52.212-4\. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement, the rights and licenses granted hereunder will automatically terminate, and you agree to immediately cease using the Splunk Materials and to return or destroy all copies of the Splunk Materials, including any documentation, and other Splunk Confidential Information in your possession or control and certify in writing the completion of such return or destruction in accordance with Section 14.6\. In the event of termination of this Agreement, Splunk will have no obligation to refund any License Fees, Support Fees, or other fees received from you during the Term. Section 1 (Definitions), Section 3.5 (solely with respect to indemnity), Section 6 (Ownership), Section 9 (Software Verification and Audit), Section 11 (Warranty Disclaimer), Section 12 (Limitation of Liability), Section 13 (Purchased Software Indemnity), Section 15 (Termination) and Sections 16 (Severability) through 22 (General) shall survive termination of this Agreement.

**16.**     **SEVERABILITY. ** Unless otherwise provided herein, all rights and remedies, whether conferred hereunder or by any other instrument or law, will be cumulative and may be exercised singularly or concurrently. The failure by either party to enforce any provisions of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any other right hereunder or of any subsequent enforcement of that or any other provisions. The terms and conditions stated herein are declared to be severable. If a court of competent jurisdiction holds any provision of this Agreement invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect, and the provision affected will be construed so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent permissible by law.

(ii) If a dispute arises between You and Splunk that is related to a Government customer that is subject to the Contract Disputes Act, 41 U.S.C. § 7101 et seq., concerning issues of fact or law which relate to this Agreement (a "CDA Dispute"), the following dispute procedures shall apply. If the U.S. Government issues a final decision regarding a CDA Dispute, such decision shall be provided within ten (10) days of receipt by You by written notification to Splunk and subsequently binding upon Splunk to the same extent it is binding upon You, subject to Splunk's right to seek additional time, cost or both. Splunk shall continue performance in accordance with the decision pending any appeal that may be initiated pursuant to the provisions below.

Failure of the parties to reach agreement on any request for equitable adjustment, claim, appeal, or action arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be a dispute to be resolved in accordance with the clause at 48 C.F.R § 52.233-1, which is incorporated in this Agreement by reference.

**2.6.8**     <u>Customer’s Obligation to Assist.</u> Should you report a purported defect in the Software to Splunk, Splunk may require you to provide them with the following information: (a) a general description of the operating environment, (b) a list of all hardware components, operating systems and networks, (c) a reproducible test case, and (d) any log files, trace and systems files. Your failure to provide this information may prevent Splunk from identifying and fixing that purported defect.

**2.6.9**     <u>Software Upgrades and Software End of Life Policy.</u>  When available, Splunk provides updates, upgrades, maintenance releases and reset keys only to Splunk Support customers.  Software comes with a three digit number version. The first digit represents the major release (i.e. upgrade), the second digit identifies the minor releases (i.e. updates) and the third digit identifies the maintenance releases.  With a new major version, the number to the left of the decimal is changed and for minor releases, the number to the right of the decimal point is increased. Subject to the foregoing, Splunk provides full Support, including, when available, bug fixes, only on the current major release and (a) the immediately prior major release or (b) twenty-four months from the then current major release, whichever period is greater (“**_Supported Prior Versions_**”).   

**2.7**     **Changes in Support and Software**.  Subject to Section 2.6.9, You acknowledge that Splunk has the right to discontinue the manufacture and development of any Software and the Support for any Software, including, without limitation, the distribution of older Software versions, at any time in its sole discretion, provided that Splunk agrees not to discontinue Support for the Software during the current annual term of these Terms and Conditions, subject to the termination provisions herein.  Splunk reserves the right to alter Support from time to time, using reasonable discretion but in no event shall such alterations result in (i) diminished support from the level of Support set forth herein; (ii) materially diminished obligations for Splunk; (iii) materially diminished  rights for you; or (iv) higher Support Fees during the then-current term.  Splunk shall provide you with thirty (30) days prior written notice (delivered electronically or otherwise) of any permitted material changes to the Support contemplated herein.   

**3.**     **TERM AND TERMINATION.**

**3.1**     **Term.**  These Terms and Conditions will commence on the date when Splunk delivers the license key for the Software to you and, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, for a period of one (1) year (or for term purchased if different than one year) thereafter (the “**_Initial Term_**”). The agreement will automatically renew for additional one (1) year terms (or for term purchased if different than one year) (each, a “**_Renewal Term_**,” and the Initial Term, collectively with any and all Renewal Terms, shall be referred to as the “**_Support Term_**”), unless either party provides the other (or if purchased through a reseller, you provide reseller) with written notice of its intent not to renew the agreement at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then current Initial Term or Renewal Term.   If you allow your Support Term to expire, it must expire for all of your licenses.  If you would like to re-instate Support, it must be re-instated for all of your licenses.  You may seek to re-activate Support by submitting a purchase order that includes fees for the lapsed period plus a re-instatement fee.

**3.2**     **Survival.**  The rights and obligations of the parties contained in Sections 1 and 3.2 will survive the expiration or termination of the Agreement, these Terms and Conditions or any Order Document(s).
